# Live-Comment-Module-Project

This project as the name suggests is a Live commenting display module on a Web page.
It is made possible with the use of JSP, Servlet, UserBean class and a MySQL Database.
The Web Page (JSP) is having two sections here: Comment section (left) and a display section (right)

The idea is that new users who wants to write some comments/reviews about anything can do so by providing some details like name, email, mobile no. and a message/comment.
And whatever the users which submit as message/comment will be displayed on the right display screen live.
The concept of this is not anything new but I wanted this to work like a real comment section where the new comments just goes down in a list one after the other fashion.
This was made possible with the help of MySQL database, Session tracking and Servlet/JSP.
The project is still in process since I want to add another module called an Admin module to make so that the admin of the product whom the users are writing comments and reviews can respond back if like
or can look into stuff as suggested by users and reply them back using their contact info.
